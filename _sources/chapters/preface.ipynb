    "# Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) (GEE) is a cloud computing platform with a [multi-petabyte catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. During the past few years, GEE has become very popular in the geospatial community and it has empowered numerous environmental applications at local, regional, and global scales. GEE provides both JavaScript and Python APIs for making computational requests to the Earth Engine servers. Compared with the comprehensive [documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine) and interactive IDE (i.e., [GEE JavaScript Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com)) of the GEE JavaScript API, the GEE Python API has relatively little documentation and limited functionality for visualizing results interactively. The **geemap** Python package was created to fill this gap. It is built upon a number of open-source Python libraries, such as the [earthengine-api](https://pypi.org/project/earthengine-api/), [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/), [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet), and [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets). Geemap enables users to analyze and visualize Earth Engine datasets interactively within a Jupyter-based environment with minimal coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book takes a hands-on approach to help you get started with the GEE Python API and geemap. You'll start with the fundamentals of geemap by creating and customizing interactive maps. You'll then learn how to load cloud-based Earth Engine datasets and local geospatial datasets onto the interactive maps. As you advance through the chapters, you'll walk through practical examples of using geemap to visualize and analyze Earth Engine datasets, and will learn about exporting data from Earth Engine. You will also learn about more advanced topics such as building and deploying interactive web apps with Earth Engine and geemap."

    "## What this book covers\n",
    "\n",
    "_Chapter 1, Introducing GEE and geemap_, covers the basics of using the GEE Python API and setting up the Python environment for using geemap.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Chapter 2, Creating Interactive Maps_, teaches how to create and customize interactive maps with various plotting backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Chapter 3, Using Earth Engine Data_, covers the fundamental data types of Earth Engine. We will learn how to search and load Earth Engine datasets onto an interactive map here!\n",
    "\n",
    "_Chapter 4, Using Local Geospatial Data_, teaches how to load local vector and raster datasets onto an interactive map. We will also learn how to download data from OpenStreetMap.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Chapter 5, Visualizing Geospatial Data_, looks at the various tools and techniques for visualizing geospatial data, such as split-panel maps, linked maps, timeseries inspector. We will also learn how to create map elements such as color bars, legends, and labels here.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Chapter 6, Analyzing Geospatial Data_, covers statistical methods and machine learning techniques for analyzing geospatial data, such as zonal statistics, unsupervised classification, supervised classification, and accuracy assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Chapter 7, Exporting Earth Engine Data_, teaches how to export vector and raster data from Earth Engine. We will also learn how to download thousands of image chips from Earth Engine within a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Chapter 8, Making Maps with Cartoee_, teaches how to create publication-quality maps with the cartoee module. We'll learn how to plot Earth Engine data on the map and how to customize map projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Chapter 9, Creating Satellite Timelapses_, provides practical examples of using geemap to create timelapses from satellite and aerial imagery, such as Landsat, GOES, MODIS, and NAIP.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Chapter 10, Building Web Apps_, teaches how to build interactive web apps with Earth Engine and geemap from scratch. We will also learn how to deploy web apps to the cloud for public access.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Chapter 11, Earth Engine Applications_, covers various Earth Engine applications, such as surface water mapping, land use and land cover change, vegetation dynamics, and wetland mapping."

    "## To get the most out of this book\n",
    "\n",
    "This book assumes that you are at least a Python novice, which means that you are comfortable with the basic Python syntax, such as variables, lists, dictionaries, loops, and functions. If you know how to make lists and define variables and have written a `for` loop before, you have enough Python knowledge to get started! To get the most out of this book, we highly encourage you to type the code yourself in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter notebook, JupyterLab, Google Colab). This will help you understand the code and help you understand the book. You can also download the code examples from the book's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/giswqs/geebook). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code."
