    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) is a widely used cloud-computing platform in the geospatial community. It features a multi-petabyte data catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets, enabling users to easily and efficiently visualize, manipulate, and analyze geospatial data. Built upon the [Earth Engine Python API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install) and open-source mapping libraries, [geemap](https://geemap.org) makes it much easier to analyze and visualize Earth Engine datasets in a Jupyter environment. Since its initial release in April 2020, geemap has become the most popular Python package for interactive analysis and visualization of Earth Engine data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter covers the fundamentals of Geospatial Data Science, Google Earth Engine, and geemap. We will walk through the process of setting up a conda environment and installing geemap. Additionally, we will explore how to utilize geemap with Google Colab without needing to install anything on your device. Finally, we will provide some useful resources for further learning about Earth Engine and geemap beyond the scope of this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Geospatial Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Before introducing geospatial data science, we need to understand what **data science** is. The term \"data science\" has gained a lot of attention during the past decade, along with related terms such as **big data**, **data analytics**, and **machine learning**. According to [Google Trends](https://bit.ly/40lfnpW), the online search interest over time in \"data science\" has experienced a rapid increase since 2016 (see {numref}`ch01_google_trends`). When we googled \"data science\", 4.1 billion records were returned, compared to 7.6 billion on \"big data\", 2.6 billion on \"machine learning\", and 1.9 billion on \"data analytics\". Interestingly, the interest in \"big data\" has been decreasing since 2018, while the interests in \"data science\" and \"machine learning\" continue to increase.\n",

    "Online search interest trends on data science-related keywords by Google as of March 28, 2022. The numbers on the vertical axis represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region (worldwide) and time (2004-2022). A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so what is **data science**? Data science is a broad term that encompasses many areas of interest. From a high-level perspective, data science is the science of data or the study of data {cite}`Cao2017-eb`. From the disciplinary perspective, data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains {cite}`Dhar2013-lk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geospatial data science** is a discipline within data science that specifically focuses on the spatial component of data. It brings forth theories, concepts and applications that are specific to geographic data in the realm of data science {cite}`Hassan2019-ub`. A good example of geospatial data science is NOAA's analysis of spatial and temporal datasets (e.g., satellite imagery, weather data, and climate models) to provide hurricane forecasts using statistics, machine learning, and mathematical models {cite}`Eftelioglu2017-gi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Google Earth Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud computing platform with a multi-petabyte [data catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets {cite}`Gorelick2017-mz`. During the past few years, GEE has become very popular in the geospatial community, and it has empowered numerous environmental applications at local, regional, and global scales {cite}`Amani2020-vb,Boothroyd2020-fx,Tamiminia2020-df,Wu2019-at`. Since GEE became publicly available in 2010, there has been an exponential growth in the number of peer-reviewed journal publications empowered by GEE (see {numref}`ch01_gee_pubs`). Based on the most recent bibliometric analysis, there are 1,077 peer-reviewed journal publications with the word “Google Earth Engine” in the title and 2,969 publications with the word \"Google Earth Engine\" in either the title or abstract. In 2022, the number of publications with “Google Earth Engine” in the title or abstract reached 1,150, which is more than a 280-fold increase from the year 2014 with only 4 publications.\n",

    "## What is geemap\n",
    "\n",
    "GEE provides users with both JavaScript and Python APIs for making computational requests to the Earth Engine servers. While the GEE JavaScript API has robust [documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine) and an interactive IDE (i.e., [GEE JavaScript Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com)), the GEE Python API has relatively limited functionality for visualizing results interactively, and there is a lack of documentation. The **geemap** Python package was created to fill this gap {cite}`Wu2020-br`. It is built upon a number of open-source Python libraries, such as the [earthengine-api](https://pypi.org/project/earthengine-api), [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium), [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet), and [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) packages. Geemap enables users to analyze and visualize Earth Engine datasets interactively within a Jupyter environment with minimal coding (see {numref}`ch01_geemap_gui`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geemap** is intended for students and researchers who would like to utilize the Python ecosystem of diverse libraries and tools to explore Google Earth Engine. It is also designed for existing GEE users who would like to transition from the GEE JavaScript API to the Python API. Geemap provides an interactive graphical user interface for converting GEE JavaScript projects to Python scripts without coding. It can save users a lot of time and effort by providing a simple interface for exploring and visualizing Earth Engine datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "The geemap package has some optional dependencies, such as [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org) and [localtileserver](https://github.com/banesullivan/localtileserver). These optional dependencies can sometimes be a challenge to install, especially on Windows. Therefore, we advise you to closely follow the recommendations below to avoid installation problems. Note that installing geemap will automatically install all of its dependencies, including the earthengine-api package. Therefore, you do not need to install the earthengine-api package separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ch01:conda)=\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing with conda\n",
    "\n",
    "To install geemap and its dependencies, we recommend you use the [conda](https://conda.io/en/latest) package and environment manager. This can be obtained by installing the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) (a free Python distribution for data science), or through [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (minimal distribution only containing Python and the conda package manager). Also see the [installation docs](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html) for more information on how to install Anaconda or Miniconda locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geemap is available on the [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/geemap) Anaconda channel, a community effort that provides conda packages for a wide range of software. Creating a new conda environment to install geemap is not strictly necessary, but given that some geemap dependencies might have a version conflict with other geospatial packages in an existing conda environment, it is a good practice to start fresh by installing geemap and its dependencies in a clean environment for your project. The following commands create a new conda environment named `gee` and install geemap in it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n gee python\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we began by covering the fundamentals of Geospatial Data Science, Google Earth Engine, and geemap. We then provided guidance on setting up a conda environment for installing geemap and its dependencies. Additionally, we walked through the process of using geemap with Google Colab as a cloud-based alternative to a local installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you should have a fully functional conda environment that is ready for working with Earth Engine and geemap. In our next chapter, we will explore geemap in greater depth."
